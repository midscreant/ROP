                    <p class='page_paragraph'>SELAH is a children’s program that exists with the goal of providing quality, Jesus-
                        centered programing for inner city and refugee children on and around East
                        
                        Colfax. We have learned that the best way to interact with the at risk and refugee
                        littles and their families is by meeting them literally where they are! We are
                        currently meeting every Monday at the apartment complexes they live in, and
                        engage littles by playing games, doing prize giveaways, assisting with math and
                        reading skills, and most importantly, by sharing a story from God's living Word and
                        praying with the littles and their families. God is allowing us to come alongside Him
                        and share many stories from His word, bless families with physical and spiritual
                        needs, and so much more. We use the following tactics to teach God’s Word to the
                        kids, many of whom have little to no church involvement or knowledge of the Lord
                        at all:

                            currently run only one evening a week, but believe God is expanding that!</li>
