                    <p class='page_paragraph'>We offer English classes to the refugee and immigrant population in the
                        surrounding neighborhoods, to help them overcome the language barriers they
                        face living in the United States. Students are assessed and divided into four class
                        levels, based on their English proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and
                        writing. We utilize the Cambridge Ventures curriculum in each level, and
                        students are able to advance to the next level at the end of each school year.</p>

                            <li>Look for ways to teach English in the community context, outside the ROP
                                building (maybe a church, an apartment complex, etc. where people are
                                already gathered) specifically within their own language groups so students
                                can better help each other.</li>
                            <li>Build a friendship partner program for the English students to be paired with
                                an American friend who would meet with them weekly or bi-weekly.</li>
                            <li>Advertise the English program on our website and other sites that would
                                engage potential students.</li>

                        <li>Students have progressed from very beginner level (with no English ability at
                            all) to an intermediate level, with more confidence and commitment to using
                            English.</li>
                        <li>Many of our students say that ROP is the place they know they can go for any
                            help they need, and have a trusting relationship with the English teachers.</li>
                        <li>Opportunities to share about the saving grace of Jesus and how to have a
                            relationship with Him, which have come up because of conversations about
                            fear or even why Christians eat pork and Muslims don’t!</li>
